				HONK! Fest West is a non-profit organization dedicated to the activation of public space through energetic musical performance; we are part of a global renaissance of street band culture. HONK! Fest West works to break down systemic barriers to inclusion for those underrepresented within our community and underserved by arts in our region.
				<br/><br/>
				Most importantly, HONK! Fest West is YOU!!! HONK! Fest West is open for anyone who would like to pick up an instrument and play, with an instrument being as simple as stomping feet or clapping hands. This allows anyone attending the festival to immediately become part of the experience.

		<Title title="Why" subtitle="is HONK! Fest West?"/>
		<p class="content">
			HONK! Fest West activates public space to make communities stronger and more connected. The raucously engaging performances provide the universal benefits of celebrating music together with no limitations arising from age, race, gender identity, cultural background, ethnic and indigenous identity, native language, immigration status, ability, religion, education, socioeconomic status, or sexual orientation. HONK! Fest West focuses on cooperative values; participatory culture; breaking down barriers to music and art; introduction to different cultural traditions through music; and the key tenet that anyone can be a part of the experience.
