						Below is a list of currently open roles within the Organizing Committee. These positions are distinguished between Committee-level roles and Long-term Volunteer roles. What’s the difference?
						<br/>
						* **Committee Roles** usually have an increase in responsibility and commitment. They are also expected to attend all regular committee meetings.
						* **Long-term Volunteer Roles**, aka Super-Volunteers, are usually roles that fit into a planning committee. They are not expected to attend regular meetings of the Organizing Committee and report to a committee level lead. These roles tend to have less responsibility and commitment throughout the year.
